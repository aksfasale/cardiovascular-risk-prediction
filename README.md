Cardiovascular diseases, also called CVDs, are the leading cause of death globally, causing an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity.

## üéØ Objective :
The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patient's information. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.

## üìä Data Description :
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.

This dataset has the following 17 variables as explanatory variables:
### Demographic:
‚Ä¢ Sex: male or female("M" or "F")

‚Ä¢ Age: Age of the patient;(Continuous - Although the recorded ages have been truncated to whole numbers, the concept of age is continuous)

### Behavioral
‚Ä¢ is_smoking: whether or not the patient is a current smoker ("YES" or "NO")

‚Ä¢ Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.(can be considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes, even half a cigarette.)

### Medical( history)
‚Ä¢ BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Nominal)

‚Ä¢ Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal)

‚Ä¢ Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Nominal)

‚Ä¢ Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal)

### Medical(current)
‚Ä¢ Tot Chol: total cholesterol level (Continuous)

‚Ä¢ Sys BP: systolic blood pressure (Continuous)

‚Ä¢ Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)

‚Ä¢ BMI: Body Mass Index (Continuous)

‚Ä¢ Heart Rate: heart rate (Continuous - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.)

‚Ä¢ Glucose: glucose level (Continuous)

### Predict variable (desired target)
‚Ä¢ 10-year risk of coronary heart disease CHD(binary: ‚Äú1‚Äù, means ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, ‚Äú0‚Äù means ‚ÄúNo‚Äù)

## üìã Summary
This project mainly aims at developing a supervised machine learning model to predict the risk of heart disease in indiviuduals. It is based on an ongoing study in Framingham, Massachusetts.

The project has been conducted in 5 steps:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Transformation
4. Model Building and Evaluation
5. Hyperparameter Tuning

Engineered an important feature of pulse pressure using systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

The result is a XGBoost model with almost 87% accuracy, 89% precision and 84% recall.
